# SSV360
A Dataset for Standing and Seated Viewing of 360° Videos on Subjective Quality Assessment

## Abstract
SSV360 dataset containing psychophysical and psychophysiological data gathered in a pilot study on the effect of standing and seated viewing of 360 videos on subjective quality assessment. The stimuli were shown to the participants on a head-mounted display for both viewing conditions. The ground truth contained in the SSV360 dataset may support, e.g., benchmarking of immersive media processing algorithms and developing objective perceptual quality metrics.

## Dataset Structure
The SSV360 dataset contains the following three main folders:

1- Seated_viewing_ACR_SSV360

	Contain six sub-folders relating to the data type and the information about the participants:
		1- Data_ACR_MOS
		2- Data_ACR_HMD
		3- Data_ACR_EYE
		4- Data_ACR_GSR
		5- Data_ACR_SSQ
		6- Data_ACR_TimeStamp
		Participants_Information.csv

2- Standing_viewing_ACR_SSV360

	Contain six sub-folders relating to the data type and the information about the participants:
		1- Data_ACR_MOS
		2- Data_ACR_HMD
		3- Data_ACR_EYE
		4- Data_ACR_GSR
		5- Data_ACR_SSQ
		6- Data_ACR_TimeStamp
		Participants_Information.csv

3- Coded_scenes

	contains information regarding the coded reference videos and corresponding test videos, and the instructions for the download link of the 120 videos.
