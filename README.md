# SSV360
A Dataset for Standing and Seated Viewing of 360° Videos on Subjective Quality Assessment

## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce the SSV360 dataset containing psychophysical and psychophysiological data gathered in a pilot study on the effect of standing and seated viewing of 360 videos on subjective quality assessment. The stimuli were shown to the participants on a head-mounted display for both viewing conditions. The ground truth contained in the SSV360 dataset may support, e.g., benchmarking of immersive media processing algorithms and developing objective perceptual quality metrics.
